This Program is made as a project for the course ME351(design of machine elements) at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. In this program you can design weld joints without knowing about any design failure theories. The program will output factor of safety for a particular settting according to your input along with a plot of factor of safety vs maximum applied load.
